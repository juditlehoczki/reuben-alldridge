      <h1 name="#about">About me</h1>
      <p>I am an active teacher, conductor and trombonist.</p>
      <p>
        After graduating from Leeds College of Music in 2002 I worked as a
        professional trombonist on cruise ships all over the world for a number
        of years.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then gained a PGCE in instrumental music from Birmingham City
        University and started a busy teaching career in Shrophire and the West
        Midlands while continuing to tour with professional shows and bands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subsequently I also gained a Postgraduate Certificate in trombone from
        Birmingham Conservatoire.
